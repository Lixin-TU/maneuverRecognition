    "#### Windowing and Train-/Test-Splitting with preprocessing.timeseries_train_test_split\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to create a model which can correctly identify driving maneuvers in unknown data of future driving recordings. Therefore, to train the model, we cannot simply use the individual maneuvers already assigned to their IDs, but have to use a sliding window to create training and testing cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do that, we are in need of two specific functions:\n",
    "1. A windowing function that gets our data and returns windows with a specific amount of time steps and a specific step length between those windows in the shape of (cases, timesteps, variables).\n",
    "2. A function to split the data into training and testing data before the windowing is applied. If we do not split training and testing data before using the windowing function, there will be data leakage because overlapping windows may end up in both partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose we can use the timeseries_train_test_split function in the preprocessing module. It first splits the given dataframe in an arbitrary number of partitions. Then it randomly selects some of these partitions in regard to our test size and removes them from a copy of the full dataframe. The remaining data will be used for training. We can also use this function to apply a robust scaling which will use the training data for fitting the scaler. The windowing function will then be applied on the training and testing partitions separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this approach, it can still happen occasionally that we create unnatural transitions between maneuvers that occurred before and after the partitions we cut out for the test data or that we break some maneuvers. However, the amount of it which depends on the number of splits we use will be negligible, as it is clearly more important that we have absolutely no data leakage. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following parameters can be configured:\n",
    "- splits: Number of random partitions in which data will be separated before windowing will be applied.\n",
    "- test_size: Proportion of data to use for testing.\n",
    "- time_steps: Length of windows in number of rows.\n",
    "- step_size: Steps between windows in number of rows.\n",
    "- scale: Bool whether we apply robust scaling or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have data of three different persons and to ensure that different route segments of the trips can appear in the training and test data we will apply the timeseries_train_test_split function on each individual dataset and combine the windowed data subsequently. Our windows will have a length of 20 timesteps which is 10 seconds in our dataset and we will use a stepsize of 4 timesteps which equals 2 seconds. We then merge the data, with every window seperated and already in the right shape."
